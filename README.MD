#StringWrapper

###as simple as it goes :)

A very, VERY simple OOP Wrapper for string functions in PHP. I tried to keep the original function names as methodnames, however, in ridiculous cases like `stristr()`, I took the liberty to create my own name.

Full method documentation will be available ... soon. Maybe. Idk. I'm lazy.
